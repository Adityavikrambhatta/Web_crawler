Design Document for Backend System for Efficient Web Content Crawling and Query Response
1. Introduction
1.1 Background
In the digital age, the vast amount of information available on websites presents both an opportunity and a challenge. While the internet is a rich source of knowledge, efficiently navigating and extracting specific information from web pages can be daunting for users. Traditional search engines provide a broad solution for information retrieval, but they often lack the capability to offer precise, context-specific answers from individual websites. This project aims to address this gap by developing an intuitive and interactive backend system to engage with and understand web content.
1.2 Problem Statement
There is a growing need for more intuitive and interactive methods to engage with and understand web content. Users face challenges in navigating and extracting specific information due to the diverse structure and presentation styles of websites.
1.3 Objectives
System Design: Create an efficient backend system for crawling and loading website content.
Robustness and Accuracy: Develop a system capable of handling high volumes of queries and delivering accurate results.
Scalability: Ensure the system can scale to accommodate increasing volumes of website content and user queries.
1.4 Scope
The project's scope is centered on backend development, including system architecture design, algorithm development, and backend implementation. It excludes front-end user interface development, though a minimal front-end addition is desirable.
1.5 Expected Outcomes
A backend system capable of processing and extracting website content for a given URL.
An integration with an existing LLM to analyze website content and respond to user queries based on this content.
Accurate and prompt responses to user queries.
2. System Architecture
2.1 High-Level Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following components:
Web Crawler: Responsible for fetching and downloading website content.
Content Processor: Parses and processes the downloaded content.

Stores processed content in a query-friendly format.
2.2.3 Query Engine
Function: Analyzes the processed content and responds to user queries using an existing LLM.
Technologies: Integration with LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Google BERT).
Features:
Interprets user queries using the LLM.
Matches queries with relevant content.
Returns accurate and context-specific answers.
2.2.4 Backend API
Function: Interfaces with the front-end and handles user requests and responses.
Technologies: Node.js with Express.
Features:
Receives and processes user queries.
Communicates with the query engine and returns results.
Provides endpoints for integration with front-end applications.
2.3 Front-End (Minimal Addition)
Function: Provides a minimal user interface for interacting with the backend.
Technologies: React.
Features:
Basic interface for users to input queries and view results.
Integrates with the backend API for query submission and response display.
2.4 Database
Function: Stores processed content and user queries.
Technologies: MongoDB.
Features:
Efficient storage and retrieval of web content.
Scalable to handle large volumes of data.
3. Algorithm Development
3.1 Content Extraction Algorithm
Objective: Efficiently extract relevant information from web pages.
Approach:
Use HTML parsing to identify and extract key elements.
Clean and preprocess the extracted text.
Store the cleaned text in a structured format for querying.
3.2 Query Analysis and Response Algorithm
Objective: Analyze user queries and match them with relevant content using an existing LLM.
Approach:
Use the LLM to interpret user intent.
Implement a matching mechanism to find the best content matches.s
Return the most relevant and accurate responses.
4. Scalability and Performance
4.1 Scalability
Vertical Scaling: Enhance server capabilities to handle more requests.
Horizontal Scaling: Distribute the load across multiple servers.
Load Balancing: Implement load balancers to manage traffic and ensure high availability.
